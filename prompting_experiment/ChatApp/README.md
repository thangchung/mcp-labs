# AI Chat with Custom Data

This project is an AI chat application that demonstrates how to chat with custom data using an AI language model. Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](https://aka.ms/dotnet-chat-templatePreview2-survey).

>[!NOTE]
> Before running this project you need to configure the API keys or endpoints for the providers you have chosen. See below for details specific to your choices.

### Known Issues

#### Errors running Ollama or Docker

A recent incompatibility was found between Ollama and Docker Desktop. This issue results in runtime errors when connecting to Ollama, and the workaround for that can lead to Docker not working for Aspire projects.

This incompatibility can be addressed by upgrading to Docker Desktop 4.41.1. See [ollama/ollama#9509](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/9509#issuecomment-2842461831) for more information and a link to install the version of Docker Desktop with the fix.

# Configure the AI Model Provider

## Using GitHub Models
To use models hosted by GitHub Models, you will need to create a GitHub personal access token. The token should not have any scopes or permissions. See [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

Configure your token for this project using .NET User Secrets:

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the ChatApp.AppHost project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage User Secrets".
2. This opens a `secrets.json` file where you can store your API keys without them being tracked in source control. Add the following key and value:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings:openai": "Endpoint=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com;Key=YOUR-API-KEY"
   }
   ```

## Setting up a local environment for Qdrant
This project is configured to run Qdrant in a Docker container. Docker Desktop must be installed and running for the project to run successfully. A Qdrant container will automatically start when running the application.

Download, install, and run Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/). Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

Note: Qdrant and Docker are excellent open source products, but are not maintained by Microsoft.

# Running the application

## Using Visual Studio

1. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
2. Press `Ctrl+F5` or click the "Start" button in the toolbar to run the project.

## Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) for Visual Studio Code.
3. Once installed, Open the `Program.cs` file in the ChatApp.AppHost project.
4. Run the project by clicking the "Run" button in the Debug view.

## Trust the localhost certificate

Several .NET Aspire templates include ASP.NET Core projects that are configured to use HTTPS by default. If this is the first time you're running the project, an exception might occur when loading the Aspire dashboard. This error can be resolved by trusting the self-signed development certificate with the .NET CLI.

See [Troubleshoot untrusted localhost certificate in .NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/untrusted-localhost-certificate) for more information.
